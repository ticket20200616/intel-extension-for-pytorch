IPEX GPU Learning:

1. Dispatch Mechanism
2. Enabling SYCL
3. SYCL Extensions on GPU: Local Vectorization and Matrix Computation Features

Backend implemented through PyTorch dispatch mechanism: virtd.
Virtd represents a Virtual Device, essentially a simulated device, primarily to demonstrate the use of the dispatch mechanism.
Operations for virtd are still performed on the CPU, and memory management continues to use malloc/free.
Currently, only step 1 is implemented; steps 2 and 3 need to be gradually introduced.
